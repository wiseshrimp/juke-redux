Laptops come in all different shapes, sizes, brands, names, etc! The initial task in this exercise is to create a Laptop Constructor Function that defines general properties and functions all Laptops have in common.  Then apply the general Laptop Constructor to create another type of Laptop, a Macbook.

Next, implement an inheritance utility by two different means: using `Object.create` and using the `new` keyword. This utility will link the prototype chain of Macbooks to Laptops.
