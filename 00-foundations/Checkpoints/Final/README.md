# Foundations Checkpoint

Please read the instructions below carefully. We assume you still have Testem installed; if not, please run `npm install -g testem`.

## Starting

1. **Important: Fork (not clone)** this repository to your own Github user account.
* Clone your forked repo to your local machine.
* `npm install`
* Run `npm test` and load the URL displayed in your terminal.

## Procedure

### Rules

This checkpoint is similar to the Test First exercises â€” reverse engineer each spec, and write code to pass it. **Do not alter** any of the TestSpecs unless instructed to do so; ***all solutions should be written in the empty `.js` files in each folder***.

### Scoring

This checkpoint is scored out of **45 points**. In each suite, the later specs are usually more challenging / valuable. The suites are weighted as follows:

- 00_string_manipulation - 2.00 Points
- 01_reduce_right - 6.00 Points (the recursion spec is worth 3.00 out of the 6.00)
- 02_alternate_function_&_twice_function - 8.00 Points 
- 03_secret_guest_list - 9.00 Points
- 04_keyAdder - 6.00 Points
- 05_macbooks - 6.00 Points (last spec is extra credit and worth 4 Points)
- 06_interleave - 8.00 Points

### Tips

* Each folder has a README.md file; **read the README files** to get an overview of each Test Spec and Point Value, as well as problem concept.
* You are encouraged to `git commit` at regular milestones.

## Submitting

When time is complete or when you finish the code, perform the following:

1. Commit all your changes with `git commit -am "submission for deadline"`.
* **Also**: `git push` your commits back up to your own personal fork on Github.

Good luck!
